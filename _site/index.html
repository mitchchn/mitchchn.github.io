<p>Count the problems in this picture:</p>

<div class="banner">
<a href="/public/img/problem_free.png"><img src="/public/img/problem_free.png" /></a>
</div>

<p>I count eight, not including my crying-out-for-a-lightning-cable battery life and the one-bar reception on Rogers.<sup id="fnref:rogers"><a href="#fn:rogers" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Eight of the top ten “Free” iPhone apps on the App Store are not free at all. They contain in-app purchases, as Apple generously points out—in size 8-pt. Helvetica Neue, in text a few shades darker than the white background, right underneath the big blue buttons that scream <span style="color:blue">FREE</span>.</p>

<p>These warnings are an improvement over the old state of affairs. Apple first introduced <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/22/apple-adds-in-app-purchase-disclaimer-to-itunes-app-store/">in-app purchase disclaimers</a> to the App Store in March 2013. At the time, those messages were only visible in iTunes on the desktop, and only on individual app pages. It wasn’t until iOS 7.1.1, released a year later in April 2014, that Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/04/22/in-app-purchases-top-charts/">added those messages</a> to the mobile “Top Charts” listings.</p>

<p>That last change was more than past due. (It was also prompted by an FTC investigation, $32-million in refunds, and a media backlash.) But it  fell short of the mark in so many ways. It failed to address the source of all the consumer confusion over in-app purchases.</p>

<p>Apps with in-app purchases are still too easy to mistake for their free counterparts. They’re still cluttering up parts of the App Store where they don’t belong. And they’re more popular than ever, crowding out free and paid apps alike. None of these problems can be fixed with disclaimers.</p>

<p>It’s time for Apple to put its foot down and tell non-free apps where they belong. It’s time they were sent to the Freemium Ghetto.</p>

<h2 id="solution-1-merge-freemium-and-paid-apps">Solution 1: Merge Freemium and Paid Apps</h2>

<p>I don’t hate the in-app purchase (“freemium”) business model. While some companies wield in-app purchases <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/10956-Dungeon-Keeper-Mobile-Review-Wallet-Reaper">for evil</a>, plenty of small developers have chosen the freemium model as the path to <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/paper">well-deserved success</a>. Freemium is often more effective and lucrative than any other option, includings ads. Any developer in 2014 would be foolish not to consider it.</p>

<p>But that’s all the more reason why Apple needs to do keep freemium apps separate. They’re are just too good at what they do. Their cost of entry—nothing—is too compelling for paid apps to compete with, and their presence on the Free list makes it harder for apps that are truly free to distinguish themselves.</p>

<p>If the biggest problem with freemium apps is that they aren’t actually free, one possible solution is obvious: group them with the paid apps instead. That way, consumers could browse the Free listings without having to worry about spending a cent, and all monetized apps would compete on the same level.</p>

<p>This option is alluring in its simplicity. But it’s the wrong approach, both for consumers and developers. Here is what the App Store might look like if freemium and paid apps shared a single “Paid” list:</p>

<p><a href="/public/img/problem_paid.png"><img src="/public/img/problem_paid.png" /></a></p>

<p>See the problem? In this scenario, only a handful of paid apps would make it near the top ten.<sup id="fnref:speculate"><a href="#fn:speculate" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The playing field would be far from level.
In a merged list, freemium apps would have to put up with the stigma of the “Paid” label, and paid apps would be buried even deeper by the freemium competition. Nor would consumers be any less confused by the melange of payment outcomes than they are now. It’s a bad deal for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="solution-2-the-freemium-ghetto">Solution 2: The Freemium Ghetto</h2>

<p>A better solution involves adding a third category to the “Top Charts” screen. The existing “Top Grossing” list would have to hit the chopping board, but it’s a metric that’s almost completely meaningless for consumers anyway. In its place, a new list would rise up—one where freemium apps can thrive. </p>

<p>Behold: <strong>The Freemium Ghetto</strong>.</p>

<div class="text-center banner">
<img src="/public/img/freemium_ghetto.png" class="small-image" />
</div>

<p>I’m fond of the word “Demo” because of its connotations from the gaming world. Perhaps Apple could come up with a better moniker. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that there’s a clear separation between the three types of apps on the App Store: <strong>Free</strong>, <strong>Paid</strong>, and <strong>Demo</strong> (freemium).</p>

<p>Drawing solid lines between these categories would improve the app-shopping experience immensely. In this system, it’s immediately obvious whether there’s a possibility of an app ever costing money. Gone would be the cognitive friction of having to question whether that free app you just impulse-downloaded comes with hidden costs. The App Store would feel less like a sketchy casino than it does today.</p>

<p>Better labeling for freemium apps would give paid apps more of a chance to succeed. Given the option of an app labeled “FREE” versus one that costs any amount of money, it’s obvious which one most consumers will choose. But if the decision is between a demo and a full version that costs 99 cents, the choice is more even-handed.</p>

<p>The Freemium Ghetto would be good news for freemium creators too—at least in the long run. By restricting the “free” label only to those apps that deserve it, Apple would build consumer trust and confidence in its platform. That’s something all developers should want to see happen. And by being more honest about their business model, developers would avoid the kind of PR disasters that happen when children (or childish adults) waste hundreds of dollars on an app or game they mistakingly believed to be free.</p>

<p>Clearer categorization would make parental controls easier for device owners to understand and set up. Don’t want your kids to spend any money on their iPhones? Just disable purchases for “demos” or disable access to demos entirely. More transparency and control would go a long way to lift the negative stigma weighing the freemium model down. (I’ve never heard of a developer being attacked for calling a demo a demo.)</p>

<p>But the best part for developers? An exclusive category for apps with IAP would help those apps get more exposure. No longer would they have to compete with free apps for their positions in the ranking. In the Freemium Ghetto, the majority of freemium apps would be more visible than they are now.</p>

<p>So think about it, Apple: embrace the Freemium Ghetto. It might sound like kind of scary change that will make certain big name game publishers angry, but it’d be worth it. Do it for your customers. Do it for your developer community. Do it the future of the App Store.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night I went to bed pretty pleased with myself. My article abut the <a href="/2014/os-x-terminal">OS X command line</a> had found some traction on reddit, pulling in a few hundred visitors over the course of an evening. Not bad for a week-old personal blog, eh?</p>

<p>I was in for one hell of a surprise. When I woke up on Thursday morning—my 25th birthday—the number of pageviews had reached 30,000. By Friday evening, just over 100,000 people had seen my article. And it feels like a good tenth of them have responded in some way: comments, compliments, and criticism. Gratitude. Typo corrections. Sage advice. Birthday wishes.</p>

<p>To someone entirely unused to online notoriety, it feels as though a very geeky flash mob materialized in my apartment one evening, stayed for dinner, then went home and reviewed my cooking on Yelp. I am a little dazed.</p>
