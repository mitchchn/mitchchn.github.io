    <p>Count the problems in this picture:</p>

<p><a href="/public/img/problem_free.png"><img src="/public/img/problem_free.png" /></a></p>

<p>There are eight of them (not including my crying-out-for-a-lightning-cable battery levels and the one-bar reception on Rogers<sup id="fnref:rogers"><a href="#fn:rogers" class="footnote">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Eight of the top ten “Free” iPhone apps on the App Store are not free at all. They contain in-app purchases. I know this for a fact because Apple helpfully points it out in size 7-pt. Helvetica Neue—in text a few shades darker than the white App Store background—right underneath big blue buttons that scream “FREE”.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this tiny concession to transparency is an improvement over the old state of affairs. Apple first introduced <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/22/apple-adds-in-app-purchase-disclaimer-to-itunes-app-store/">in-app purchase disclaimers</a> to the App Store in March 2013. At the time, those messages were only visible in iTunes on the desktop, and only on individual app pages. It wasn’t until iOS 7.1.1, released a year later in April 2014, that Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/04/22/in-app-purchases-top-charts/">added those warnings</a> to the mobile “Top Charts” listings.</p>

<p>The move was more than past due. (It was also prompted by an FTC investigation, $32-million in refunds, and a media backlash.) But it wasn’t nearly enough to stem the confusion and annoyance caused by freemium apps cluttering up the Free list. </p>

<p>I don’t hate the in-app purchase model (also known as “fremium” or “free-to-play” in the gaming world). While [some companies] have been known to use in-app purchases <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/10956-Dungeon-Keeper-Mobile-Review-Wallet-Reaper">for evil</a>, many small developers have achieved well-earned success thanks to the same model. By all measures, freemium is an attractive way of doing business on mobile. Any developer in 2014 would be foolish not to consider it.</p>

<p>But that’s all the more reason why Apple needs to do a better job at separating apps with hidden purchases from their free and paid counterparts. Freemium apps are just too good at what they do. Their lack of an upfront cost is too compelling for paid apps to compete with, and it also makes it harder for apps that are truly free to distinguish themselves.</p>

<h2 id="not-all-non-free-apps-are-alike">Not all non-free apps are alike</h2>

<p>If the biggest problem with freemium apps is that they aren’t actually free, one possible solution is obvious: group them with the paid apps instead. That way, consumers could browse the free listings without worrying about having to spend a cent, and all monetized apps would be put on the same level. This kind of change would by easy for Apple to implement, and it’s alluring in its simplicity. But I also think it’s the wrong approach, for consumers as well as developers.</p>

<p>This is what the App Store might look like if freemium and paid apps shared a single “Paid” list:</p>

<p><a href="/public/img/problem_paid.png"><img src="/public/img/problem_paid.png" /></a></p>

<p>See the problems? Mixing “free” apps with paid apps would be just as confusing for consumers as mixing “free” apps with free apps. Nor would this solution do much to level the playing field for paid apps: I can only speculate as to the true order of such a list, but it’s a no-brainer that free apps with IAP would continue to outpace those with a cost of entry.</p>

<p>On a merged list, developers of freemium apps would have to deal with the added stigma of the “Paid” label, and developers of paid apps would find themselves being pushed far down the list by “free” competition. It’s a bad deal for everyone.<sup id="fnref:kind"><a href="#fn:kind" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-freemium-ghetto">The Freemium Ghetto</h2>

<p>A better solution involves adding a third list to the “Top Charts” screen. Notice that I said third, not fourth: “Top Grossing” is a metric that’s almost completely meaningless for consumers, and it should be removed or hidden somewhere less prominent. In its place, there would be a new list—one where freemium apps can thrive. Behold: <strong>The Freemium Ghetto</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/freemium_ghetto.png" width="65%" /></p>

<p>I chose the word “Demo” for my mockup because I’m fond of its connotations from the gaming world. Perhaps Apple could come up with a better moniker. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that there’s a clear separation between the three kinds of apps on the App Store: <strong>Free</strong>, <strong>Paid</strong>, and <strong>Demo</strong> (Freemium).</p>

<p>Drawing solid lines between these categories would help consumers immensely. It would remove the cognitive overload of having to figure out if an app is really “free”. Even off the chart, apps with IAP would signify their status by wearing a “Demo” button instead of a “Free” button. The addition of a third category would also open up space on the Free list, giving truly free apps (and their developers) more exposure.</p>

<p>Removing the word “Free” from freemium apps would give paid apps more of a chance to succeed. Given a choice between a free app and an app that costs any amount of money, it’s obvious what a consumer will choose. If that choice is between a demo and a full app that costs 99 cents, the decision is a little more balanced.</p>

<p>But I also believe the Freemium Ghetto could be a good thing for freemium creators, at least in the long run. By being more honest about their business model, developers could avoid the kind of PR disasters that happen when children (or childish adults) accidentally waste hundreds on an app that they believed was free. And having a separate ranking would elevate freemium apps that are currently lower down on the Free list. In the Freemium Ghetto, those apps would be more visible than they were before.</p>

    </li>
    <li id="fn:kind">
      <p>In fact, my imagined list is probably too kind to paid apps: in the absence of truly free competition, freemium apps would fare even better in the rankings than they do already. Merging freemium and paid apps onto a single list would only <em>further disadvantage paid apps</em> on the App Store. And in today’s mobile market, paid apps need all the help they can get. <a href="#fnref:kind" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
