    <p>Count the problems in this picture:</p>

<p>I count eight, not including my crying-out-for-a-lightning-cable battery life and the one-bar reception on Rogers.<sup id="fnref:rogers"><a href="#fn:rogers" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Eight of the top ten “Free” iPhone apps are not free at all. They contain in-app purchases. Apple generously spells it out for us—in size 8-pt. Helvetica Neue, in text a shade darker than the white background,underneath big blue buttons that scream <span style="color:blue">FREE</span>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>These warnings, new as of iOS 7.1.1, are a welcome addition to the platform. (It only took an FTC investigation, $32-million in refunds, and a media backlash.) But they don’t address the problem of freemium creep on the App Store.</p>

<p>Apps with in-app purchases are still too easy to mistake for their free counterparts. They’re still cluttering up parts of the storefront where they don’t belong. And they’re more popular than ever, crowding out free and paid apps alike. None of those problems can be fixed with disclaimers.</p>

<p>It’s time for Apple to put its foot down and tell non-free apps where they belong. It’s time they were sent to the Freemium Ghetto.</p>

<h2 id="solution-1-merge-freemium-and-paid-apps">Solution 1: Merge Freemium and Paid Apps</h2>

<p>I don’t hate the freemium business model. Some companies wield in-app purchases <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/10956-Dungeon-Keeper-Mobile-Review-Wallet-Reaper">for evil</a>, but plenty of small developers have found<a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/paper">well-deserved success</a> by releasing their product for free with paid upgrades.</p>

<p>Freemium apps can be hugely effective, and that’s all the more reason why Apple needs to move them somewhere else. They’re are just too good at what they do. Their cost of entry—zilch—is just too compelling. They bulldoze everything in their path.</p>

<p>But where to put them? One possibility is to group freemium apps with paid apps instead of free apps. That way, consumers could browse the Free listings without having to worry about spending a cent, and all monetized apps would compete transparently and on the same level.</p>

<p>Here is what the App Store might look like if freemium and paid apps shared a single “Paid” list:</p>

<p><a href="/public/img/problem_paid.png"><img src="/public/img/problem_paid.png" /></a></p>

<p>This scenario would be a kick in the pants for developers of traditional paid apps. Only a handful would ever make it near the top ten when pitted against “free” competition. Freemium developers wouldn’t be so happy either. They’d have to put up with the stigma of being “Paid”. And consumers wouldn’t be any less confused by the melange of payment options than they are now. Merging lists is a bad deal for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="solution-2-the-freemium-ghetto">Solution 2: The Freemium Ghetto</h2>

<p>A better solution requires a third type of app and a third category on the “Top Charts” screen. (The existing “Top Grossing” list would have to hit the chopping board, but that metric’s almost entirely meaningless for consumers anyway.) A new list would rise up—one where freemium apps could thrive: </p>

<p><strong>The Freemium Ghetto</strong>.</p>

<div class="text-center banner">
<img src="/public/img/freemium_ghetto.png" class="small-image" />
</div>

<p>All apps now belong to one of three types: <strong>Free</strong>, <strong>Paid</strong>, and <strong>Demo</strong> (freemium).<sup id="fnref:demo"><a href="#fn:demo" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Drawing solid lines between these groups would improve the app-shopping experience immensely. In this system, it’s immediately obvious whether there’s a possibility of an app ever costing money. Gone is the constant need to question whether that free game you just impulse-downloaded has hidden costs. The App Store would feel less like the casino that it resembles today.</p>

<p>Better labeling for freemium apps would give paid apps more of a chance to succeed. Given the choice between an app labeled “FREE” and one that costs a buck, it’s obvious what most consumers will choose. But if the decision is between a demo and a full version, the choice is more even-handed.</p>

<p>The Freemium Ghetto would be good news for freemium creators too—at least in the long run. By reserving the “FREE” label for those apps that truly deserve it, Apple would build consumer trust and confidence in its platform. That’s something all developers should want to see happen.</p>

<p>More honesty would help developers avoid the kind of PR disasters that happen when children (or childish adults) waste hundreds of dollars on an app or game they mistakingly believed to be free. Parents would find the three-way distinction easier to understand than the existing choice between Paid, Free and “Free.”</p>

<p>But the best part for developers? An exclusive category for apps with IAP would do wonders for exposure. No longer would freemium apps have to compete with free apps for their positions in the ranking. In the Freemium Ghetto, the majority of freemium apps would be more visible than they are now.</p>

<p>So think about it, Apple: embrace the Freemium Ghetto. It might sound like kind of scary change that will make certain big name game publishers angry, but it’d be worth it. Do it for your customers. Do it for your developer community. Do it the future of the App Store.</p>

      <p>I’m fond of the word “Demo” because of its connotations from the gaming world. Perhaps Apple could come up with a better moniker. It doesn’t matter.
