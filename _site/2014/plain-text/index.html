    <p><strong>Text is free.</strong>  That’s “free” as in speech and in beer. Text is an open format. No one company owns it or can charge you money to read or edit your own work.<sup id="fnref:microsoft"><a href="#fn:microsoft" class="footnote">1</a></sup> You get to choose your own tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Text is universal.</strong> Any computer [phone, tablet] can open plain text. You can keep your plain text files in <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and work on them from from wherever you are. Text looks the same everywhere, so you can share it with editors and collaborators without worrying about different software versions or formatting issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Text is distraction-free.</strong> Text editors are fast, lightweight, and have few bells and whistles. Some are designed <a href="http://bywordapp.com">especially for writers</a>. The lack of options and formatting lets you focus on your writing.</p>
