## 4. How

You only need two things to write for the web: ** computer and a text editor**.

If you have friends who study computer science, they might tell you that Real Programmers use Linux. If they work at trendy startups, they will tell you to buy a MacBook Pro. Don't listen to them. Any computer can churn out code.[^1]

You'll need a text editor write plain text -- the native format of the web. Anything you publish online, whether it originates in a Word document or Wordpress or a scrap of paper, ends up as a plain text file somewhere on a web server. For this reason (among others) many professional web writers choose to ditch MS Word and produce all their content in plain text. So it's a good idea to get comfortable using a text editor -- not just for coding, but also for writing copy.

You can go ahead and use the text editor that came with your computer, but there are good, free alternatives that will make your life easier. For Windows users, I recommend [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/). For Mac users, you can't go wrong with [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). Both editors are simple to use, but powerful enough to create anything you see on the web.

Once you've installed an editor, practice creating and saving text files. You'll notice that if you save your files with the extension `.html`, your editor will recognize that you're writing HTML code and colour the tags apropriately. This handy feature helps you distinguish your code from your copy:

Good editors have plenty more advanced features -- none of which you need to start coding. Speaking of which, in the next post we'll be writing basic HTML â€” specifically, HTML5: the newest version and the best one yet for writers. Stay tuned.

[^open]: The web is an open standard. As journalists, we're used to media conglamorates owning the air we breathe, but no one company controls the web. The same free technologies that you use to run your blog also power the biggest news sites.  That means that web writers are free to choose our own tools. There's no web equivalent to Photoshop, for instance.
